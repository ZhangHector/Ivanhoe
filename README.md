Introduction
------------

Learning Software Design is a big topic of our target. Therefore, we believe the
project of Ivanhoe is a good way to improve us about understanding Agile Development.
This project is designing over TDD and JUnit test. Therefore, we could get familiar with
those two technical skills. Design Pattern is technical important to Software Design; we
could get the experience of learning how to implement Design Pattern into the program of
Ivanhoe. And we could study the Scenario and how to evaluate each Scenario. We are
looking forward to implement the network into the program because Ivanhoe is a multiplayer
game. It is very great to implement the network feature into the game.
